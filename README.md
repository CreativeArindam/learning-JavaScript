# learning-JavaScript
It is just for a learning purpose. In this project user can edit an array. He/She can add, remove and display the array items by entering "add", "remove" and "display" respectively. There are many other functionalities like quit. I have tried to solve the problem of entering UpperCase or LowerCase values. User can access the same functions when he/she enters the values in different cases. "Remove","remove" and "rEmoVe" have the same function. I have also tried to solve the problems when a user enters a "unknown" value. I have given the necessary instructions to fix the problem when he/she enters a "unknown" value.

Thank you!
